# Biomass-Production-Analysis

This project examines advanced statistical techniques to analyze the Linthurst data to determine the primary physicochemical properties influencing aerial biomass production in the Cape Fear Estuary of North Carolina. The study uses the dataset given with 14 predictors and focuses on employing Principal Components Regression, Collinearity Diagnostics, and Ordinary Least Square Estimation to determine the correlations between different soil properties and biomass production. Furthermore, variable selection techniques such as stepwise regression, ridge regression, and subset selection methods are investigated on a reduced 5-predictor dataset. The project's objectives are to reduce collinearity, identify critical predictors, and improve knowledge of the intricate interactions between environmental conditions and aerial biomass production.
